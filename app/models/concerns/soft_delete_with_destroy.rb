# soft_deletion gem doesn't destroy relations with dependent: :destroy, only safe_delete's them if they are
# safe_deletable. This leads to orphaned records of safe_deleted objects. This fills in the missing logic in the
# gem -- finding all child records which are not safe_deletable and have the dependent: :destroy callback and deleting
# them.
